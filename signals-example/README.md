# Signals Examples

This directory contains various examples demonstrating how to use the reactive signals system and render method.

## Examples

### 01-basic-counter.html
Basic counter example showing:
- Using `createSignal` to manage state
- Using `createComponent` to create reusable components
- Using `html` template literals
- Using `render` to mount components

### 02-todo-list.html
Todo list application demonstrating:
- Managing arrays with signals
- Dynamic rendering of lists
- Adding and removing items
- Toggling item state

### 03-timer-cleanup.html
Timer with automatic cleanup showing:
- Using `createEffect` for side effects
- Using `onCleanup` to clean up intervals
- Automatic cleanup on component unmount

### 04-computed-memo.html
Computed values example demonstrating:
- Using `createMemo` for derived values
- Automatic recalculation when dependencies change
- Multiple computed values working together

### 05-form-validation.html
Form validation example showing:
- Multiple signals working together
- Real-time validation with `createMemo`
- Conditional rendering based on validation state
- Form submission handling

### 06-component-composition.html
Component composition example demonstrating:
- Creating reusable components
- Passing props between components
- Nesting components
- Conditional rendering of child components

### 07-effects-demo.html
Effects and cleanup demonstration showing:
- How `createEffect` tracks dependencies
- Using `onCleanup` for cleanup callbacks
- Returning cleanup functions from effects
- Component-level cleanup

## Running the Examples

1. Open any HTML file in a modern web browser
2. Make sure the file paths are correct relative to your project structure
3. The examples use ES6 modules, so you may need to serve them via a local server:

```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (http-server)
npx http-server

# Using VS Code
# Install "Live Server" extension and right-click on HTML file -> "Open with Live Server"
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000/signals-example/01-basic-counter.html`

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Signals**: Reactive state management with `createSignal`
- **Effects**: Side effects with automatic dependency tracking via `createEffect`
- **Memos**: Computed/derived values with `createMemo`
- **Cleanup**: Automatic resource cleanup with `onCleanup`
- **Components**: Reusable UI components with `createComponent`
- **Rendering**: Mounting components with `render`
- **Templates**: HTML template literals with the `html` helper
